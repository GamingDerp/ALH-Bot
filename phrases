Hi :)
Bro, please stop doing this command. It's annoying.
I watch you every night. I know your secrets. Right now as you're reading this I'm looking through your webcam. Watching your every move. Now you're looking at your camera. You don't see the light on that it's recording, but I'm watching. I always am. ***Look behind you.***

The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. ***Ding*** A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. ***Ding***  Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word "start". On your mark, get ready, ***Ding***
Oh~ :flushed:

Derp had to censor or delete some of the phrases so I can be added to big servers :3
I live in Spain but without the 'S'

*Pats your head* "You're a good derplet."
Fun Fact: German soldiers during WW2 used to do meth in small quantities so they'd be able to fight longer and stay focused more.

I met Michael Jackson once when I was 9 years old. || It was a touching experience. ||
I sexually identify as Michael Jackson. || My pronouns are He/Hee ||
My daughter told me im a terrible father. || I don't know how she could say such a thing, she barely knows me. ||
Whats another name for the Make-A-Wish foundation? || Final Fantasy ||

Just once, I want the opportunity to dramatically swipe everything off a table to make room for a giant map that I'll use to explain the plan.
I don't know how to explain this, but Thursday, October, and 8:00 PM all have the same vibe.
Jesus **Christ**, this server looks like something you'd find on a USB left in a Burger King bathroom.
"What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany’s at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It’s priceless. As I’m taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It’s her father’s business. She’s Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don’t trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he’s the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She’s been waiting for me all these years. She’s never taken another lover. I don’t care. I don’t show up. I go to Berlin. That’s where I stashed the chandelier." -Dwight Schrute
Being a grandpa must be tough, some baby mispronounces a word and suddenly your name is "Peepo" for the last 30 years of your life.
You are not a *"witch"* Sabrina. You are just mentally ill and own candles.
I think my favorite part of every plane flight is during the take off when the pilot screams "Bend to my will metal sky bird and take us to the big blueness!" and all the passengers chant "Sky bird! Sky bird!" To convince the plane to take off.
The year is 2000. You're 13 years old, alienated from everyone around you, and deeply mentally ill. However, many of the varieties of Sobe brand lizard milks are available at gas stations near you.
You jump 13.7% higher if you are being chased by a Japanese person.
Why is "baked" pronounced "baked", but "naked" isn't pronounced "naked"?
Hello, you have stumbled upon the last phrase. It is currently 11:19 PM for me right now, I am eating Nacho Cheese Doritos, drinking a Pepsi, and wondering why I'm staying up so late on a Wednesday night when I have things to do tomorrow. If you get this phrase, DM me (GamingDerp#1915) a screenshot of it and I will buy you Discord Nitro Classic ||I won't, that was a lie|| anyways, I'm gonna go lay in my bed and be on my phone for an hour before actually going to sleep, fully knowing I have to be up in about 6 hours. Goodnight my Derplets. Cya in the morning. -GamingDerp
